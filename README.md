# Simon-Challenge
Game of Simon modified to play like the real thing.
I recall that after every successful sequence the user was able to enter, the computer would go ahead and replay the previous sequence. 
It would then add a new item to the sequence and then wait for the user response.  It would check every entry of the user to make sure it is following the sequence accordingly.
